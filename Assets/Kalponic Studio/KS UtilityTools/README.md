# KS UtilityTools

Small collection of editor and runtime utility helpers.

Purpose
- Provide handy utilities (editor helpers, inspectors, small runtime helpers) that speed up development.

Quick Start
1. Open the folder in the Project window to inspect available utilities.
2. Many utilities are used directly from scripts; check each tool's example usage in its source file.
3. For editor tools, look under `Tools` menu or the Editor folder for custom windows.

What to expect
- Lightweight, single-purpose utilities that you can copy into other projects.
- Example usage is usually shown in XML comments or the top of the script file.

Troubleshooting
- If a tool doesn't appear in the Editor menu, confirm the script is inside an `Editor` folder and there are no compile errors.

License & Contact
- Free to use unless otherwise specified. Contact the author for commercial licensing or support.
